# Becoming a fucking data science hero :punch: :running: :books:

This project is about how I am learning data science. I'm just a guy from Colombia who got to know a bit about data science and got passionate about it. But the way to become a data scientist is not clear and involves a lot of technical and mental knowledge that at some point surpassed me.

Note: It is very likely that there are mistakes with my English. I am sorry!! I am also using this project to practice English.

Now, what I want is to change my learning strategy inspired by [John Washam](https://startupnextdoor.com/about/) and his [repository](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/main/translations/README-es.md#el-plan-diario),
I started a plan to become a data scientist, a HERO!!!.

So, let me start with this :v: :muscle:.

## Why become in a Data Scientist?
I don't know, maybe I love the pain...or maybe I just want to keep learning every
day of my life. That's my principal motivition. If you think like me, try to become
in a data scientist too.

## My personal history until know..
I studied a bachelors degree in civil enginering and that was the best selection
that I never took 'cause shaw me that I don't want to continue in that path. 

## Where to start?
In this section I'm gonna write an index to become in the hero DS, so maybe you
consider take over path and you're free to do it.

1. Read the README of the repository mentioned forgoing
2. Start a project in Jira(or other similar software) using scrum metodology.
    I selected this framework 'cause allow me to have deadlines and be clear
    about what and how I want study. I'v started watching some videos on how
    implement Scrum in Jira. Here my recommendation []
